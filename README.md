# Mesa Geo Models

This repository contains a set of agent-based simulation models developed using the Mesa and GeoMesa frameworks. These models are geared towards understanding various dynamics ranging from classroom interactions to the spread of infections and rumors.

## Models Overview

1. **classroomABM.ipynb**: An agent-based model that simulates classroom interactions and dynamics.
   
2. **infectionABM.ipynb**: A simulation focused on understanding the spread of infections within a given population.

3. **money_model_tut.ipynb**: A tutorial-style notebook detailing how to simulate economic transactions among agents.

4. **rumorABM.ipynb**: An agent-based model that simulates how rumors or information spread among a set of individuals.

5. **infectionGeo/infectionGeo.ipynb**: A geospatially enhanced model that simulates the spread of infections, taking spatial data into account.

6. **EnvGeo/EnvGeo.ipynb**: A model focused on understanding environmental dynamics using geospatial data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Mesa and GeoMesa libraries
- Other Python libraries as specified in each notebook

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jameschen256/Mesa_Geo_Models.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
